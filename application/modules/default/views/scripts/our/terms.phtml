  <p><strong>Transfers</strong></p>
  <p> Our transfers team will make every effort to help you move your site to us. However, transfers are provided as a courtesy service, and we can not make guarantees regarding the availability, possibility, or time required to complete an account transfer. Each hosting company is configured differently, and some hosting platforms save data in an incompatible or proprietary format, which may make it extremely difficult if not impossible to migrate some or all account data. We will try our best, but in some cases we may be unable to assist you in a transfer of data from an old host.The free transfer services are available for 30 days from your sign up date. Transfers outside of the 30 day free period will incur a charge; please contact a member of the transfers department with specific details to receive a price quote.</p>

    
    <p><strong>Account Setup / Email on file</strong></p>
     <p>WinWinHost will setup your account after we have received payment and we and/or our payment partners have screened the orders in case of fraud. It is user's responsibility to provide us with an email address which is not @ the domain you are signing up for. If there is ever an abuse issue or we need to contact you, the primary email address on file will be used for this purpose. It is user's responsibility to ensure the email address on file is current and up to date at all times. If you have a domain name registered with WinWinHost, it is your responsibility to ensure that the contact information for your domain account and your actual domain name is correct and up-to-date. WinWinHost is not responsible for a lapsed/delayed registration due to outdated contact information or out of order email server being associated with the domain. If you need to verify or change this information, you should contact support team via email or chat. Providing false contact information of any kind may result in the termination of user's account. In dedicated server purchases or high risk transactions, it will be necessary to provide government issued identification and possibly a scan of the credit card used for the purchase. If users fail to meet these requirements, the order may be considered fraudulent in nature and may be denied.</p>
